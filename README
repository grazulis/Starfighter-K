Starfighter-K is a very old-style tunnel game, based on an old ASCII game, designed to work with the Kinect.
Built using the MS Kinect SDK. 
TO play hold out your arms and tilt them as though flying to move the Starfighter-K from left to right. 
You can play using the keyboard if you switch the IFighterController to use the KeyboardController instead of the KinectController.
Still a lot left to do; implment scoring, speed, start and re-start after game over. Maybe a boss battle.
