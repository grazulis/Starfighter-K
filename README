Starfighter-K is a very old-style tunnel game, based on an old ASCII game, designed to work with the Kinect.
Built using the MS Kinect SDK. 
To play hold out your arms and tilt them as though "flying" (like when playing as a kid) to move the Starfighter-K from left to right.
Move hands behind you to speed up, move them forwards to slow down.
You can play using the keyboard if you switch the IFighterController to use the KeyboardController instead of the KinectController.
Still a lot left to do; re-start after game over, catching escape pods, multi-player. Maybe a boss battle.
